        "# **Introduction**\n",
        "This project implements a dictionary of Hawaiian sayings (ʻŌlelo Noʻeau) along with their English translations and explanations. The dictionary is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage sayings using robust data structures and algorithms to ensure quick access and scalability.\n"

        "# Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
        "## Choice of Data Structures\n",
        "We have chosen to implement the dictionary using a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST), specifically an AVL Tree, to maintain the sayings in alphabetical order based on their Hawaiian version. The AVL Tree ensures that the tree remains balanced after every insertion and deletion, providing O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, to support the `MeHua` and `WithWord` operations efficiently, we utilize Hash Maps (Dictionaries) to index words to the sayings that contain them. This allows for O(1) average-case time complexity for word-based lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Choice of Algorithms\n",
        "### AVL Tree Algorithms:\n",
        "*   **Insertion**: Inserts a new saying while maintaining the AVL balance properties.\n",
        "*  **Deletion**: Removes a saying and rebalances the tree if necessary.\n",
        "*   **Traversal**: In-order traversal to retrieve sayings in alphabetical order.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hashing for Word Indexing:\n",
        "*   **Indexing Words**: Each word in both Hawaiian and English is mapped to the sayings that contain it.\n",
        "*   **Lookup**: Quickly retrieves all sayings containing a specific word.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Efficiency and Effectiveness\n",
        "### Balanced BST (AVL Tree):\n",
        "*   **Efficiency**: Guarantees O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches, making it suitable for dynamic datasets where the number of sayings can grow.\n",
        "*   **Effectiveness**: Maintains sorted order, which is essential for operations like `Member`, `First`, `Last`, `Predecessor`, `Successor`, and `Insert`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hash Maps:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Efficiency**: Provides average-case O(1) time complexity for insertions and lookups, which is ideal for the MeHua and WithWord operations.\n",
        "*   **Effectiveness**: Facilitates quick retrieval of sayings based on specific words without scanning the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall:\n",
        "The combination of a balanced BST for ordered operations and hash maps for word-based lookups ensures that the dictionary is both efficient and scalable, capable of handling a large number of sayings with minimal performance degradation."
